##Time Complexity

The time complexity of a code depends on the size of the input, not on the computer running the code. 
So, if you have bigger input, it will take longer to run the code. 
Simple as that!

##Code
'''package Strivers_A2Z_DSA_Course;

public class time_and_space_complexity {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            System.out.println("Ayush");
        }
    }
}'''
# Letâ€™s observe the steps for this code:

# First, the assigning step(i = 0) will be done.
# The second step will be the comparison i.e. i < 10.
# The third step will be the print statement (i.e. System.out.println("Ayush");).
# The fourth step will be the increment(i.e. i++).
# In the fifth step, the updated value of i will be again checked i.e. the comparison(i < 10).
# In the sixth step, the print statement will be executed and so on.
